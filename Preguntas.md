# repos
Test

I found the course itself quite complete, it taught us how to use github correctly, create a profile, use the repository, etc.
I would like to learn more about github, how it could be used in everyday cases and how it affects the development of technology and programming.
what complicated me the most was the pull reques because I had never made a delivery this way before and my main mistake was to add the markdown in main and not create it in a separate branch, which when doing pull reques I had never done before. 
which when doing pull reques told me that there were coinidences between main and my markdown file, I solved it by creating a separate branch and adding it to the pull request.

Github seems to me a very complete platform that helps to the informatics development.
